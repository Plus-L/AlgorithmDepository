 * @program: AlgorithmDepository
 * @description: 第一题 - 社会关系连接
 * Given a social network containing n members and a log file containing m timestamps
 * at which times pairs of members formed friendships, design an algorithm to determine
 * the earliest time at which all members are connected (i.e., every member is a friend
 * of a friend of a friend ... of a friend). Assume that the log file is sorted by timestamp
 * and that friendship is an equivalence relation. The running time of your algorithm should
 * be mlogn or better and use extra space proportional to n.
 * 感觉没有理解透彻，大题意思是一个社交网络，n个成员，然后有一个日志文件里面存放的是在某一时间戳。一对成员成为了朋友
 * 要求的是最早在什么时候所有人都被连接
 * 其实就是并查集问题，要求mlogn以及n的额外空间
